# Portfolio Website Back End
Hi, this is the back end of [my portfolio website](bernicojc.com). Run this to run on local.

```
python app.py
```

Furthermore, there are several files that is used to easily add and remove to the projects and feedback.
```
python db_config_software_adder.py
```

This project is a full stack development of a portfolio website utilizing ReactJS frontend and Python Flask backend. This is where I store my projects and to introduce myself to the world about my skills and what I do. I display my software projects and other development projects. Furthermore, I also display my resume here, and it uses SQLAlchemy for its database on the feedback forms and its projects.
